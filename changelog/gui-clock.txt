Changelog:
GUI Clock
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gui-clock

=========
v3.1: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.0: Added feature to lower the clock when a potion effect is active, to prevent overlap. Can be toggled with the 'lowerClockWhenPlayerHasEffects' config option, enabled by default.

=========
v2.6: Added clockWidthOffset config option to allow users to change the x coordinate of the clock. Fixed the clock icon not actually being centered with clockPositionIsCenter and showOnlyMinecraftClockIcon enabled.

=========
v2.5: Fixed showOnlyMinecraftClockIcon not working correctly in combination with mustHaveClockInInventoryForGameTime set to false.

=========
v2.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.3: Updated GUI Clock to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.2: Fixed clock being outside of the screen when changing certain config values.

=========
v2.1: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v2.0: Fixed potion effects overlapping the GUI clock.

=========
v1.9: Added config option 'showOnlyMinecraftClockIcon', disabled by default. Which when enabled makes only the Minecraft clock icon show on the screen instead of time in numbers.

=========
v1.8: Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.7: Added day counter. Enabled by default, can be turned off in the config.

=========
