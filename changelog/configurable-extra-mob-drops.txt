Changelog:
Configurable Extra Mob Drops
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configurable-extra-mob-drops

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.5: Fixes the problems caused by Mojang's launcher update.

=========
v2.4: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.

=========
v2.3: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.2: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.1: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.2: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.9: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.8: Fixed mobs with the Misc category not being shown in the mob drop list. Specifically Iron/Snow Golems and Villagers.

=========
v1.7: The mod now correctly parses all characters in item names, like ¢.

=========
v1.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.5: Added support to the cemd command for modded entities with the same name.

=========
v1.4: Fixed the command not choosing the right entity from the input.
Fixed drops not being able to stack with others due to an nbt tag.
Added itemstack amount in confirmation message.

=========
v1.3: Updated Configurable Extra Mob Drops to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Improved drop chance handling. Fixes issue with multiple drops.

=========
v1.1: Added the ability to add a drop chance.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
