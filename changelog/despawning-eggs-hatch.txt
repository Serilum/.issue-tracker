Changelog:
Despawning Eggs Hatch
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/despawning-eggs-hatch

=========
v3.0: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.9: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.8: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.6: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.5: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.4: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.3: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.2: Updated Despawning Eggs Hatch to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.1: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v2.0: Updated modid.
Added the config option 'eggOnlyHatchesWhenOnTopOfHayBlock' which when enabled only hatches an egg when it despawns on top of a hay block. This prevents wild chicken colonies from expanding without your knowledge.

=========
v1.3: Improved code efficiency.
Added configurable radius option for the entity limiter check.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: Chickens now spawn at the exact location where an egg has despawned, which prevents them from getting stuck in fences and other half-blocks.

=========
v1.1: Newly hatched chickens are now babies, can be toggled in the config.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
