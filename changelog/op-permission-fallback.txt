Changelog:
OP Permission Fallback (Fabric)
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/op-permission-fallback

=========
v1.2: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.6: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.1: Increased mod compatibility by disabling mixins when another mod changes the target method, which before this would cause a hard crash.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
