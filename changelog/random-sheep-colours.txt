=========
v1.4: Updated Random Sheep Colours to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.3: Fixed config not generating correctly.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.1: Fixed baby sheep changing colour when they're grown. They now remain the same colour they were when born.

=========
v1.0: initial release of mod.
