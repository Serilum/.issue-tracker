Enchanting Commands
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchanting-commands

=========
v2.3: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.2: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.1: Improved compatibility with modded enchantments.

=========
v2.0: Added suggestions to the /ec command. You can now use Tab to autocomplete enchantment names.
The mod now gets available enchantments from the registry, instead of a list.
(1.19 only) Fixed the wrong enchantment being applied.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.8: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.7: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.6: Updated Enchanting Commands to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.5: The enchanting command is now compatible with command blocks.

=========
v1.4: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Updated modid. Updated usage text to work with any set command in the config.

=========
v1.3: [1.16.1 only] Updated mod to work with forge version 32.0.67 and above.

=========
v1.2: Added config option to change the default /ec command.
Fixed type in curse_of_binding enchantment string.

=========
v1.1: Updated modid.
Improved code efficiency.
Fixed mod not working correctly in a multiplayer environment.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
