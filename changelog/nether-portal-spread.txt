Changelog:
Nether Portal Spread
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nether-portal-spread

=========
v7.7: Improved compatibility with other mods.

=========
v7.6: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v7.5: Changed computeIfAbsent to use Collective's HashMapFunctions. This adds compatibility with threaded dimensions.

=========
v7.4: Fixed modded spreading blocks not being parsed correctly.

=========
v7.3: Changed how values in HashMaps are put. Instead of using an event, it uses the computeIfAbsent Java function.
This fixes incompatibilities with other mods creating dimensions/levels without using the event.

=========
v7.2: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v7.1: Fixed ResourceLocationException while parsing the prevent spread block by sanitizing the input.

=========
v7.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v6.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v6.5: Fixes the problems caused by Mojang's launcher update.

=========
v6.4: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v6.3: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v6.2: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v6.1: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v6.0: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v4.0: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v5.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated to work with the latest snapshot 22w11a.

=========
v5.7: (Fabric 1.18 only) Updated mod to work with 1.18.2 and future snapshots.

=========
v5.7: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v5.6: Changed the default spread config file.

=========
v5.5: (Fabric only) Fixed mod not loading correctly in a server environment with a custom spread block set.

=========
v5.4: The mod now uses Collective's block determination functions to increase compatibility for modded blocks and to make updating easier.

=========
v5.3: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v5.2: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v5.1: Improved compatibility with modded dimensions. Fixed a bug of portals not being saved in the correct dimension folder.

=========
v5.0: The mod now works multi-dimensional. If a dimension is added where nether portals are allowed, it'll be able to spread.
Changed delay config to work with ticks. Minimum is 1 tick. The config value has been changed to spreadDelayTicks.

=========
v4.6: Updated Nether Portal Spread to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v4.5: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v4.4: Added compatibility for the Immersive Portals mod.

=========
v4.3: Fixed an incorrect world folder path being used in a server environment.

=========
v4.2: Improved how the mod handles portals in unloaded chunks.

=========
v4.1: NullPointerException hotfix.

=========
v4.0: The mod has been almost completely rewritten. It now saves portal locations in ./world-folder/data/netherportalspread/portals/, and detects portals when a player creates one or when someone goes through an inactive portal from the nether to the overworld. This makes the mod a lot more efficient.
The spread code now runs entirely on the main thread, solving incompatibility problems with other mods which caused crashes.
Added option (enabled by default) which displays portal coordinates in portal messages.
Added a new default config for Minecraft version 1.16, which uses a lot of the new blocks.

=========
v3.5: Improved backend code.
Added configurable message to broadcast to players within the radius when a portal is broken.

=========
v3.4: Improved code efficiency.
Changed default amount of preventspread blocks needed from 2 to 4.
The mod now checks for instanceof NetherPortalBlock to increase compatibility with other modded nether portals.

=========
v3.3: Fixed latest mod update not working correctly in multiplayer environments.
Fixed default config values set too low.
Changed default spread message on portal creation.
Changed block to readable string format.

=========
v3.2: Updated modid.
Improved code efficiency.
Added a feature to the mod where on portal creation a message is send to player around the portal informating them of the spread, and how to stop it. Also added a message to confirm the stop of the nether spread when the preventspread blocks are added within the radius. This is connected to 4 new config options to control the functionality.

=========
v3.1: Updated modid.
Improved code efficiency.
Fixed nullpointerexception when switching dimensions.
Fixed custom spread block not registering correctly.
Updated default spread config file. 
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v3.0: Adds a config file in ./config/netherportalspread/ named 'spreadsettings.txt' where can be specified which blocks convert into which and their weight. See the description for more details.

=========
v2.1: Improved spread functions so that the mod now requires less computation.

=========
v2.0: You can now stop the spread of a nether portal by placing two coal blocks within the radius.

=========
v1.1: Fixed null pointer exception when changing dimensions.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
