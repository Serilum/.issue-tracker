Changelog:
Bottle Your Xp
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bottle-your-xp

=========
v2.1: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.9: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.2: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.7: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.5: Updated Bottle Your Xp to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.4: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.3: Improved code efficiency.
You can now bottle xp while having the glass bottle in your offhand.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: The mod now runs a death event when a player dies from bottling xp, which makes it compatible with other mods like gravestones.

=========
v1.1: Fixes players in creative mod getting damaged.
You can now create bottles in creative mod without xp.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
