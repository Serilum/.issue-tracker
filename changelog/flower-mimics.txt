Flower Mimics
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flower-mimics

=========
v1.5: Improved mod incompatibility in server environments.

=========
v1.4: (1.20.2) Added extra checks which mixins should be loaded, to prevent unwanted behaviour on NeoForge.

=========
v1.3: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v1.2: Fixed an incorrect mixin reference.

=========
v1.1: Modded flowers are now loaded into the config, but the target mimic entity is left empty.
This prevents unwanted behaviour with functional modded flower blocks.
They can still be transformed, but would have to be added manually.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of Flower Mimics.
