Changelog:
GUI Compass
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/gui-compass

=========
v4.2: Added drawTextShadow config option, enabled by default. Makes the overlay text more readable.
The rendering is now stopped when the F3 screen is open.

=========
v4.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v3.0: (Fabric) Updated GUI Compass to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.9: Added modded compass compatibility.
(1.19) The recovery compass now also shows the coordinates.

=========
v2.8: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.7: Fixed holding a compass in the offhand not counting towards having one in the inventory.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.4: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.2: Updated code efficiency when the GUI format is changed.

=========
v2.1: Improved compatibility with modded compasses.
Fixed desync issues with compass directions.
Fixed a compass not being detected in the offhand.

=========
v2.0: Added the 'guiCompassFormat' config option which allows users to specify what is shown in the GUI.

=========
v1.8: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric only) Fixed incorrect project URL.

=========
v1.7: (1.17.1 only) Fixed the wrong posestack being used to render the GUI text.

=========
v1.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.5: Updated GUI Compass to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.4: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.3: Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: Modified code to prevent the compass' rotation desyncing after a while.

=========
v1.1: Backend code improvement.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
