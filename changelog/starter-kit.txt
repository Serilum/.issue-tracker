=========
v2.3: Updated Starter Kit to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Fixed non-critical error message in console.

=========
v2.1: Fixed starter kit config not being accepted with extra lines in the file.

=========
v2.0: Added '/starterkit set' command, which writes the entire inventory of the player using the command to the config file. This also means NBT Tags for things like enchantments and written books are now supported.

=========
v1.1: Fixes issue of itemstacks getting out of sync in multiplayer environments.

=========
v1.0: initial release of mod.
