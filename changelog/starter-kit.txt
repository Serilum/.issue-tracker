Starter Kit
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/starter-kit

=========
v4.2: (Fabric) Updated Starter Kit to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v4.1: Improved compatibility with other mods by running the starter kit giving logic on the next tick. This will make sure all items given by other mods are caught.
You can use the addExistingItemsAfterKitSet config option to determine what is done with those items.

=========
v4.0: Changed the default config file to use NBT data by default.
Improved handling of other mods adding items on startup such as books. They can either be removed completely or re-added after the kit has been set. Configurable via 'addExistingItemsAfterKitSet'.
Fixed some custom books not being saved correctly.
Cleaned up code.

=========
v3.9: Fixes the problems caused by Mojang's launcher update.

=========
v3.8: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v3.7: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v3.6: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v3.5: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v3.4: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.7: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v3.2: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.1: Fixed nullpointer when a command was run by a non-player.

=========
v3.0: Added support for FTB Team Islands, can be toggled in the config. The starter kit will also be set after the '/ftbteamislands create' command.
Of course a fully optional dependency.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric only) Improved how the mod loads items from the config in a server environment.

=========
v2.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v2.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.4: Improved a lot of the backend code, the mod now runs more efficiently.

=========
v2.4: Improved a lot of the backend code, the mod now runs a lot more efficient.

=========
v2.3: Updated Starter Kit to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Fixed non-critical error message in console.

=========
v2.1: Fixed starter kit config not being accepted with extra lines in the file.

=========
v2.0: Added '/starterkit set' command, which writes the entire inventory of the player using the command to the config file. This also means NBT Tags for things like enchantments and written books are now supported.

=========
v1.1: Fixes issue of itemstacks getting out of sync in multiplayer environments.

=========
v1.0: initial release of mod.
