Changelog:
Village Spawn Point
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/village-spawn-point

=========
v2.8-2.9: Added support for Biome Spawn Point. With both installed and configured, you now spawn in a village near the chosen biome.

=========
v2.7: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.

=========
v2.6: (Forge) Adds support for modded world types such as TerraForged.

=========
v2.5: Decreased world loading time by a lot. Fixing the issue of having to wait at 0% generation for a long time.
Added support for modded villages.
Added log messages for when the mod starts looking for and has found a village.

=========
v2.4: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.3: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v2.2: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.1: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.9: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.8: A bonus chest is now placed around the village spawn position if the generate bonus chest world generation option is enabled.

=========
v1.7: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.5: Updated Village Spawn Point to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.4: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.3: [1.16.2 only] Fixes ClassCastException when generating a world.

=========
v1.2: Updated modid.
Fixed worlds not generating when structure generation was disabled.

=========
v1.1: Released 1.15.2 version.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
