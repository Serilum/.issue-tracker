Changelog:
Mineral Chance
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mineral-chance

=========
v1.3: Updated Mineral Chance to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Added config option 'ignoreFakePlayers', enabled by default. Prevents simulated players (for example when another mod breaks a stone block) from dropping minerals.

=========
v1.1: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Fixed minerals dropping for players in creative mode.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
