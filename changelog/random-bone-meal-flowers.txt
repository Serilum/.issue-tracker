Changelog:
Random Bone Meal Flowers
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/random-bone-meal-flowers

=========
v3.1: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.

=========
v3.0: The wither rose is now blacklisted by default.
Changed the replacing of flowers to a server runnable.
(Fabric) Improved blacklist compatibility with other mods.

=========
v2.2: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.9: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.6: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.7: (Fabric only) Bone meal from dispensers now generates random flowers.

=========
v1.5: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.3: Updated Random Bone Meal Flowers to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Improved code efficiency.
Added blacklist feature. The mod now generates a file in /config/randombonemealflowers/ named blacklist.txt. Here you can prevent the mod from spawning a flower by adding an exclamation mark in front of the name. See the description for more details.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.1: Modded flowers will now spawn randomly, when they are registered in the ForgeRegistry.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
