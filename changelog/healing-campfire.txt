=========

=========
v3.2: Updated Healing Campfire to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v3.1: Changed the default config value of 'hideEffectParticles' from false to true.

=========
v3.0: The mod is now more efficient.
Added the config options 'checkForCampfireDelayInTicks', 'campfireMustBeSignalling', 'enableEffectForNormalCampfires'(1.16+) and 'enableEffectForSoulCampfires'(1.16+).
Fixed issue of players having the regeneration effect but not getting healed.
The regeneration effect will now refresh when players have half the configured duration left and are near the campfire.

=========
v2.3: Improved code efficiency.
Fixed the regeneration effect not applying correctly.
Added configurable option for the level of regeneration.
Switched dependency from FAB Library to the Collective library mod.

=========
v2.2: The effect by default now only works when a campfire is lit. This can be toggled in the config.

=========
v2.1: Added 0.75 seconds to the duration in seconds to prevent the timer from jumping back and forth when close to a campfire.
The mod now immediately detects a campfire placed and gives the healing effect.

=========
v2.0: Lots of code rewritten, bugs fixed.
The mod is now dependent on FAB (Find A Block) Library, which efficiently keeps track of blockstates in the world. In this case we want to of course check for a campfire block nearby.

=========
v1.7: The mod now uses the WorldTickEvent instead of the PlayerTickEvent, which should make it a lot more efficient on servers.

=========
v1.6: The mod can now heal modded passive entities as well.

=========
v1.5: Fixed some issues.

=========
v1.4: The mod now requires less computation.
Improved multi-world support.

=========
v1.3: Added a config option to hide the particle effects from the campfire regeneration.

=========
v1.2: Updated modid. Code improvement, less computation.

=========
v1.1: Campfires can now heal passive mobs as well as the player when they're within the radius around the campfire. This can be toggled off in the config file.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
