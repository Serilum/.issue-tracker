End Portal Recipe
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/end-portal-recipe

=========
v2.3: Updated End Portal Recipe to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Fixed recipe typo. Improved how the dragon egg drops from the Ender Dragon.

=========
v2.1: Fixed config file not generating correctly.

=========
v2.0: Updated modid.
Improved code efficiency.
Added two config options;
  Only allow portal frames to be picked up with Silk Touch
  Put broken portal frames directly into the inventory to lower the chance of losing them.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.1: Changed the way how the mod detects pickaxes. Paxels and other modded pickaxes are now also supported when breaking end portals.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
