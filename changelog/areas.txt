Changelog:
Areas
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/areas

=========
v2.0: Extended sign caching to improve code efficiency.
Overlapping areas with the same name will now work correctly, and not display the entering/leaving message.
Added config option 'HUD_FontSizeScaleModifier' to add the ability to increase font size.
Signs now change their content to a default state when entering only the zone prefix and nothing else.

=========
v1.4: Added config option 'giveUnnamedAreasRandomName', enabled by default, which generates a random name for an area if there is no name input. See the description for an example.

=========
v1.3: Updated Areas to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Improved mod compatibility, in this case specifically Minecolonies. Fixed IllegalArgumentException when using custom RGB values.

=========
v1.1: Fixed the mod crashing when using a custom RGB values with extra spaces. Any amount of spaces is now parsed into the correct numbers.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod. Based on Named Areas, but completely rewritten from scratch, with multiplayer in mind.
