Changelog:
Infinite Trading
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/infinite-trading

=========
v4.2: Cleaned up leftover mixin files. Fixes an error message in the console.

=========
v4.1: (1.20.*) Added official support for NeoForge. Just like Fabric and Forge, in the same jar!
Updated structure and content of mod info files.

=========
v4.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v3.2: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.1: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v3.0: The mod has been completely rewritten! Improved performance and reliance.
Added config option to disable infinite villager trades, if you for example only want infinite wandering trader trades.
(Fabric) Fixed an issue of prices going up lots (demand).
Updated mod description.

=========
v2.5: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.4: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.3: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.7: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric only) Increased mod compatibility by disabling mixins when another mod changes the target method, which before this would cause a hard crash.

=========
v2.0: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric only) Fixed a bug where trades would get more expensive on trading a lot.

=========
v1.9: The mod now uses the correct SRG mapping name which fixes a crash on startup.

=========
v1.8: The mod now uses the ObfuscationReflectionHelper to find necessary fields. Which makes the mod more efficient and updating easier.

=========
v1.7: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.6: Fixed incorrect Mojang Mapping obfuscation.

=========
v1.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.4: Updated Infinite Trading to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.3: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.2: Added support for Wandering Trader trades. Enabled by default, can be turned off in the config.

=========
v1.1: Updated modid.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
