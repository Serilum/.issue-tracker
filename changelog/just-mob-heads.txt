Changelog:
Just Mob Heads
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/just-mob-heads

=========
v7.1: Fixed the min/max values not being used correctly within the in-game config.

=========
v7.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

=========
v6.3: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v6.2: Fixes the problems caused by Mojang's launcher update.

=========
v6.1: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v6.0: Changed Fox head to Red Fox and Snow Fox heads.

=========
v5.8: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v5.7: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v5.6: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========

Added config option to restrict head drops to charged creepers only.
Updated backend code.

=========
v4.2: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v4.1: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v4.0: Updated Just Mob Heads to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v3.9: Fixed steve heads dropping for mobs without head texture data.

=========
v3.8: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version. Changed jeb_sheep droprate to 0.2.

=========

=========

=========
v3.2: Updated sheep head textures.

The Looting enchant now has an effect on the head drop chance. This can be enabled/disabled within the config file. The chance is 3.5% at level I, 4.5% at level II, and 5.5% at level III and so forth. It also works on looting levels higher than 3.

There is a seperate drop chance for all three, which is active if the specific drop chances have been enabled.
