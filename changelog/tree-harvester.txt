Changelog:
Tree Harvester
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tree-harvester

=========
v5.0: The big 5.0 update!
Improved the algorithm behind which logs and leaves should be broken. This creates better remaining trees (next to the one harvested) and no more floating leaf blocks.
Huge mushrooms can now be harvested just like trees.
The amount of time it takes to harvest a tree is determined by the amount of logs.
Added config option to increase/slow down fast leaf decay.
Improved the search for a bottom block for 2x2 trees.
Added compatibility with Stack Refill.
The mod now fires the BlockBreak and BlockPlace event.
Added blacklist feature to disable certain axe types from being able to harvest trees.
Overall improved backend code.

=========
v4.2: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v4.1: Tree Harvester will now only work with logs of the same type, which is determined on the first log broken. This is to prevent unwanted behaviour with other trees or structures nearby.

=========
v4.0: Updated backend code.
Added better compatibility for smaller and modded trees.
Added config option 'automaticallyFindBottomBlock' which allows chopping down an entire tree via a middle block, enabled by default.
Added the config options 'loseDurabilityModifier' and 'increaseExhaustionModifier' to change the amount of durability and exhaustion on chopping down a tree.
(Forge only) Fixed the 1.12.2 version replacing an incorrect sapling type.

=========
v3.2: Fixed the config value enableNetherTrees not being parsed correctly.

=========
v3.1: Saplings placed on custom dirt (e.g. modded, podzol, coarse) are now placed correctly after tree harvest. The mod now relies on Collective's Block Compare functions.

=========
v3.0: Added support for the warped trees in the nether. This can be disabled in the config. Improved support for modded saplings.

=========
v2.9: Fixed the 1.12.2 version not working on servers. Extended compatibility for modded trees by using BlockTags.

=========
v2.8: Fixed the mod thinking flowers and grass around the tree were leaves. Now only actual leaves are broken (fast leaf decay) when chopping down a tree.

=========
v2.7: Updated mod to work with the new Tool functions in Collective. Updated 1.17.1 version for changes in 37.0.24.

=========
v2.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v2.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v2.4: Updated Tree Harvester to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.3: Improved a lot of backend code. The mod is now correctly runs events to make it compatible with other statistic mods. Improved fast leaf decay for bigger trees. Fixed modded tool durability behaving incorrectly.

=========
v2.2: Fixed issue of saplings not being replaced. Fixed issues of axes not breaking correctly. Improved code efficiency. Improved the way the mod chooses the correct sapling from drops.

=========
v2.1: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v2.0: Added fast leaf decay function. The sapling can get replaced after the last leaf block has been broken.

=========
v1.7: The mod is now compatible with other mods that add a broken-tool variant instead of removing the axe on reaching the maximum durability damage.

=========
v1.6: Changed the default config value of 'instantBreakLeavesAround' from true to false.

=========
v1.5: Added config option 'instantBreakLeavesAround' which can be set to false to prevent leaf brocks from being broken when chopping down a tree.

=========
v1.4: [1.16.2 only] Fixes ClassCastException when chopping down a tree.

=========
v1.3: Improved mod efficiency.
Improved function to find and break all leaves around trees using the amount of logs found.
Added config option (enabled by default) to increase exhaustion per log harvested. Same behaviour as vanilla when breaking a block.

=========
v1.2: Separated sound code to client-only. The mod now works in multiplayer environments again.

=========
v1.1: The mod now works with all modded trees.
Fixed sound spam when using the mod to chop down a tree.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
