Grindstone Sharper Tools
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/grindstone-sharper-tools

=========
v2.3: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.2: Items will now retain name formatting when sharpened and infiniteCreativeUses config option added. Thanks @fmpreferences on Github for the pull request.
Fixed sendUsesLeftInChat config not working correctly.
The italic styling in the item name from the uses left will now be removed when the tool is no longer sharpened.
Updated mod description.
(Fabric) Improved grindstone block right-click detection.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.9: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v3.2: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.7: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.6: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.5: Updated Grindstone Sharper Tools to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.4: Fixed nullpointerexception incompatibility with other mod.

=========
v1.3: Improved code efficiency.
Fixed uses in name not applying with a custom prefix.
Changed some default config values. 
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: Removed a debug line.

=========
v1.1: Fixed a server-side error

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
