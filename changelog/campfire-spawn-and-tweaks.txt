Changelog:
Campfire Spawn and Tweaks
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/campfire-spawn-and-tweaks

=========
v2.1: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v1.9: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.8: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.3: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.6: (Forge only) Improved mod compatibility by adding the custom tool action "light_campfire" and the tool type "flint_and_steel".

=========
v1.5: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.3: Improved backend code.

=========
v1.2: You can now put anything on the campfire without your spawn being changed.
It now only changes when right-clicking a fire with flint & steel or a lit fire with an empty hand.
You can now extinguish fire with more blocks.

=========
v1.1: Fixed a block being removed below the campfire when respawning.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
