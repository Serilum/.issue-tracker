Changelog:
Save and Load Inventories
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/save-and-load-inventories

=========
v1.4: Fixed inventories not being able to load correctly when saved in different encoding format.

=========
v1.3: Updated Save and Load Inventories to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.1: Fixed problem when using /listinventories without any inventories available.
Added /loadinventory <inventory_name> <player_name> (alias /li) to load kits to other players' inventories.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
