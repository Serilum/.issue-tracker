Changelog:
Passive Endermen
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/passive-endermen

=========
v3.3: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v3.2: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v3.1: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v3.0: Passive Endermen has had a big code overhaul. Fixing incompatibilities and incorrect spawning behaviour.
Gave the mixin config file a unique identifier.
The mod is a lot more reliable now.

=========
v2.7-2.8: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v2.6: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.5: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.3: Fixed Endermen still being able to pick up blocks.

=========
v2.2: (Fabric 1.18 only) Updated to work with Minecraft 1.18.2 and future snapshots.

=========
v2.1: Fixed the config 'preventEndermenFromAttacking' not working correctly.

=========
v2.0: Updated lots of backend code to make the mod work as intended.

=========
v1.7: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.4: Updated Passive Endermen to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.3: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.2: Fixed NullPointerException crash when exploring in the nether due to an entity being null.

=========
v1.1: Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
