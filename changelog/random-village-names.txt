Changelog:
Random Village Names
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/random-village-names

=========
v3.2: Changed computeIfAbsent to use Collective's HashMapFunctions. This adds compatibility with threaded dimensions.

=========
v3.1: Changed how values in HashMaps are put. Instead of using an event, it uses the computeIfAbsent Java function.
This fixes incompatibilities with other mods creating dimensions/levels without using the event.

=========
v3.0: A big backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.
