Changelog:
Move Minecarts
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/move-minecarts

=========
v1.6: Updated Move Minecarts to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.5: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.4: Fixed being able to hold the minecart while riding it, resulting in a magical journey through the sky.

=========
v1.3: Changed default config value.
Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: The config file now actually generates.

=========
v1.1: Updated modid. Added a config option to only pick up the minecart when the player is sneaking.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
