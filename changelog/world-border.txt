World Border
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/world-border

=========
v2.3: Updated World Border to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v2.2: Fixed border loop placing players underneath ice. Synced to the latest Collective version.

=========
v2.1: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v2.0: Mod code completely rewritten.
Added support for multiple dimensions.
Added new config options.
Fixed mod not working correctly in multiplayer environments.
Improved efficiency.

=========
v1.3: Improved code efficiency.
Added dependency on the Collective library mod.

=========
v1.2: Fixed an issue.

=========
v1.1: You can now loop around the world when hitting a world border, configurable in the config. This will teleport you to the negative coordinate if you hit the positive border and vice versa. Makes for infinitely looping worlds while still limiting the size.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
