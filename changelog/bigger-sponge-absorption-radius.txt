Changelog:
Bigger Sponge Absorption Radius
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/bigger-sponge-absorption-radius

=========
v2.5: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.4: (Forge only) Changed the mixin file name to be unique, fixing overlap with other mods.
If the mod wasn't working before, this will most likely fix it.

=========
v2.4: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.3: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric 1.18 only) Updated to work with Minecraft 1.18.2 and future snapshots.

=========
v2.0: Updated mod to use mixins instead of a custom sponge block to increase compatibility.

=========
v1.6: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.5: Updated and cleaned up backend code.

=========
v1.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.3: Updated backend code.

=========
v1.2: Updated Bigger Sponge Absorption Radius to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
