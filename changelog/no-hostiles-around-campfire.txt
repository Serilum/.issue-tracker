Changelog:
No Hostiles Around Campfire
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-hostiles-around-campfire

=========
v4.5: Added support for modded campfires.
Updated mod description.

=========
v4.4: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v4.3: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v4.2: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v4.1: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v3.9: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v3.8: Increased compatibility for modded entities.

=========
v3.6: Added a list to the mod which contains specific entities which are not classified as a Monster, but can still be hostile. Improved compatibility with other mods.

=========
v3.5: (1.17.1 only) Updated mod to work with the changes made to entity removal in 37.0.24.

=========
v3.5: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v3.4: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v3.3: Now checks if a campfire is placed unlit. And if unlit, will not burn entities around. Adds compatibility with others mods.

=========
v3.2: Updated No Hostiles Around Campfire to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v3.1: Added compatibility for potential modded campfire blocks. Fixed issue when checking for a lit campfire. Updated modid.

=========
v3.0: Improved mod efficiency.
Added config options 'campfireMustBeSignalling', 'enableEffectForNormalCampfires'(1.16+), 'enableEffectForSoulCampfires'(1.16+)
Fixed mod not working correctly with mob spawners and 'preventMobSpawnerSpawns' enabled.

=========
v2.4: Improved distance calculations for entities around the campfire. Both to prevent spawn and when they should burn on placement. Should work as intended now.
Moved code to check for passengers from the collective library mod to no hostiles around campfire.

=========
v2.3: Improved code efficiency.
Switched dependency from FAB Library to the Collective library mod.

=========
v2.2: The effect by default now only works when a campfire is lit. This can be toggled in the config.

=========
v2.1: Minor bug fixes.
Campfires are now instantly detected when placed.

=========
v2.0: Lots of code rewritten, bugs fixed.
The mod is now dependent on FAB (Find A Block) Library, which efficiently keeps track of blockstates in the world. In this case we want to of course check for a campfire block nearby.
New config options.

=========
v1.5: The campfire check now uses less computation.

=========
v1.4: The mod should now work with all modded entities which are classified as a monster, via EntityClassification.

=========
v1.3: Fixed some issues.

=========
v1.2: The mod now requires less computation.
Improved multi-world support.

=========
v1.1: Code improvement, now removes campfires from memory when the chunk it's in is unloaded.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
