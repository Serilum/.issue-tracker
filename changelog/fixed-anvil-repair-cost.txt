Changelog:
Fixed Anvil Repair Cost
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fixed-anvil-repair-cost

=========
v2.3: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.3.

=========
v2.2: (Fabric) Added Mod Menu support with project links and logo.
Includes an in-game configuration screen.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric) Updated mod to Minecraft version 1.19.2.

=========
v2.0: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v1.9: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.7: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.6: When the material cost is set higher than 1, the output stack is now only shown when enough of the repair material is put in.

=========
v1.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.4: Updated Fixed Anvil Repair Cost to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.3: Changed the minimum config value of the level and material cost to 1 (or 0 for vanilla behaviour) because of the vanilla code limitation. Fixes the issue of not being able to grab the output with a value of 0.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.1: Fixed incorrect behaviour when combining items and using the wrong material to repair.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
