=========
v1.2: Updated Better Conduit Placement to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

Changed replace water function from 5x5 to 3x3 around the conduit.
