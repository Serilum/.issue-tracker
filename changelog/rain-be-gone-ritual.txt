Changelog:
Rain Be Gone Ritual
https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/rain-be-gone-ritual

=========
v2.2: (Fabric 1.19.1 only) Fixed incorrect Collective (Fabric) dependency reference.

=========
v2.1: (Fabric only) Changed the version syntax of fabric mods. Due the subversions (e.g. 1.18.1 -> 1.18.2) increasingly being different, it's no longer reliable to have the same file for all subversions of Minecraft. From now on, there will be a new release for each. This will hopefully prevent confusion and make the whole updating process a lot more reliable for me and you, the user.

=========
v2.0: (Forge 1.19 only) Updated to Forge version 41.0.94+. Use the previous uploaded file if you're on an older version.

=========
v1.8: (Fabric 1.19 only) Updated mod to work with Minecraft's latest 1.19 release version.

=========
v1.8: (Forge 1.18.1 only) Fixed mod not initializing correctly due to missing file.

=========
v1.7: Improved compatibility with modded cauldrons. You can now do the ritual with water-filled cauldrons in Minecraft 1.17.

=========
v1.6: (1.17.1 only) Fixed pack_format integer. It now correctly states 7 instead of 6, which allows the use of datapacks.

=========
v1.5: Updated source code to work with the official Mojang mappings, in preparation for 1.17 and future mod updates. Does not contain any in-game changes.

=========
v1.4: Updated Rain Be Gone Ritual to work with the new Collective update. The update attempts to inform players which download mods from illegitimate sources that it can be harmful to do so. If you are reading this on CurseForge and download your mods here, this won't affect you. Thank you for downloading mods from CurseForge and supporting the mod developers.

=========
v1.3: Fix file upload error CurseForge.

=========
v1.2: Updated backend code. Synced release code to work alongside the 1.12.2 version.

=========
v1.1: Lowered the explosion radius to only 3 blocks. The explosion is harmless to the user but not for mobs around.

=========
v1.0: Initial release of mod.
