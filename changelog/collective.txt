Collective
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/collective

=========
v6.1: Fixed Collective not loading correctly in a server environment.

=========
v6.0: The big 6.0 backend update!
Forge and Fabric (and Quilt) are now contained in one file.

This also means that the two separate project pages for Forge/Fabric will be converted to one (on CurseForge). While having a clean file list! The Fabric project page on CF will remain as a legacy for older Fabric versions.

Both versions use .json5 for their config. Old files are automatically converted.
Forge mods can now be configured in-game via the mod list with the Configure button!

Contains pre-6.0 Forge code to make Collective compatible with the current versions. Will be removed once every mod has received an update. This code is only loaded when a mod requests it, it doesn't affect performance.
